# Indicators of Anxiety and Depression Based on Reported Frequency of Symptoms

## Introduction
On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. In the weeks that followed many U.S cities limited gatherings and went into lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus. Many were isolated in their homes due to sickness or limited opportunity to work. 

## Context
In April 2020, the Household Pulse Survey was created to collect data to measure household experiences during the coronavirus pandemic. The survey focuses on the mental health impact as well as socioeconomic factors. This is still an ongoing survey as of March 2022. (last gathered data on 01/10/22) 

## Objective
To explore the impact on various populations such as by age, gender, etc.

        2. Phase 2 08/19/2020 - 10/28/2020
        3. Phase 3 10/28/2020 - 12/21/2020 
        4. Phase 3 01/06/2021 - 03/29/2021
        5. Phase 3.1 04/14/2021 - 07/05/2021
        6. Phase 3.2 07/21/2021 - 10/11/2021
        7. Phase 3.3 12/01/2021 - 02/07/2022

Note: At each phase, the survey asked about the "last 7 days". Beginning in Phase 3.2, the survey asked about the "last two weeks". It is unknown why Phase 3 has been split.  
#### Survey Questions
Adapted PHQ-2 questions:

Over the last 7 days, how often have you been bothered by … having little interest or pleasure in doing things? Would you say not at all, several days, more than half the days, or nearly every day? Select only one answer.

Over the last 7 days, how often have you been bothered by … feeling down, depressed, or hopeless? Would you say not at all, several days, more than half the days, or nearly every day? Select only one answer.

Adapted GAD-2 questions:

Over the last 7 days, how often have you been bothered by the following problems … Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge? Would you say not at all, several days, more than half the days, or nearly every day? Select only one answer.

Over the last 7 days, how often have you been bothered by the following problems … Not being able to stop or control worrying? Would you say not at all, several days, more than half the days, or nearly every day? Select only one answer

#### Scoring
For each scale, the answers are assigned a numerical value: not at all = 0, several days = 1, more than half the days = 2, and nearly every day = 3. The two responses for each scale are added together.

A sum equal to three or greater on the PHQ-2 has been shown to be associated with diagnoses of major depressive disorder.

A sum equal to three or greater on the GAD-2 has been shown to be associated with diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder.
